<p>This is an app that allows you to make an healthy diet. You will have to give 14 meals first (lunch and dinner),
and in the next page, you will give 7 meals (breakfast), and the application will shuffle correctly all the meals
so as to separate two same meals with two different ones, and it will give a table as an output.</p>
<p>After the first page, you have to input all of the breakfast informations.<br>
"Breakfast" and "Lunch and dinner" are independants. So the app will first shuffle the breakfast list,
and then shuffle the lunch and dinner one.</p>
