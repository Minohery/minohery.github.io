My name is Mino Razafimino and I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Aerospace Engineering at Mississippi State Univeristy. I am very 
  passionate about robotics and controls, and I plan on pursuing a PhD degree in Aerospace or Mechanical Engineering while pursuing Research in that.<br>
  Throughout my undergraduate career, I had the opportunity to work on several projects touching multiple fields such as Aerodynamics, Structures, and Dynamics.
  All of the projects I have worked on so far are listed on the right, and you can find more details by clicking on it. I am currently an Undergraduate Researcher
  at the Autonomous System Lab of my University and enjoy it a lot.<br>
  I also taught myself how to program, and worked on a few projects on my own. They can be found on the right under individual projects. I recently started a YouTube
  channel where I am explaining my way of thinking to solve coding problems.
