    <h3>1. Ordering app</h3>
    <p>This app allows people to choose from a list of meals.</p>
    <p>The administrator of the system can easily enable or disable users to choose their meals.</p>
    <p>Here are some screenshots of the project:</p><br>

    <h3>2. Marketplace</h3>
    <p>This is my most recent project. I put all my focus in the back-end. I used the Django framework
        to develop 3 applications: the first one is a customized login system, and I implemented Gmail API
        to send the email of confirmation to the user when he registers; the second app is an app that allows the user to set
        up a selling account using Stripe API; and finally, the third app allows the user to buy an item, using Stripe.</p>
        <p>Here are some screenshots of my application:</p><br>
        <div class="tablesp">
        
        <article class="cellsp">
        <h3>Stripe interface when user sets up a selling account</h3><br>

    <h3>3. Diet planner</h3>
    <p>This is an app that allows you to make an healthy diet. You will have to give 14 meals first (lunch and dinner),
        and in the next page, you will give 7 meals (breakfast), and the application will shuffle correctly all the meals
        so as to separate two same meals with two different ones, and it will give a table as an output.</p>
        <p>After the first page, you have to input all of the breakfast informations.<br>
        "Breakfast" and "Lunch and dinner" are independants. So the app will first shuffle the breakfast list,
        and then shuffle the lunch and dinner one.</p>
